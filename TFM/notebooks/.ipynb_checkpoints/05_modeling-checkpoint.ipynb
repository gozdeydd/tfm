    "Back then in previous 4 notebooks we have done most of the geospatial analisis and had some insights about geographic properties. However keeping an environment with geopandas is very hard with more libraries such as pycaret. For this reason we are going to examine in this notebook a pandas dataframe that has geographic variables and try to understand what affects the most damage_gra.\n",

Even though we do not use a lot of code it is not very hard to adjust it to our needs either. The most important functions, classes we use in pycaret could be listed as follows.\n",

    "In PyCaret, there are two primary approaches to implementation. One can either instantiate a Classification object (as referenced in the API documentation), or one can directly utilize functions like setup among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup function in PyCaret is the initial step to setting up any experiment, and it essentially prepares the data for further analysis and modeling. Here's a bit more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data Preprocessing: \n",
    "setup takes care of many preprocessing tasks. These include handling missing values, transforming categorical variables into numeric (via one-hot encoding or label encoding), and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pipeline Creation: \n",
    "When you use setup, PyCaret internally creates a pipeline that processes the data. This pipeline can then be used seamlessly with other PyCaret functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Customization:\n",
    "You can customize how the setup function behaves by using its many parameters. For example, you can specify the ratio of the train/test split, choose to ignore certain features, select specific normalization methods, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Environment Setup: \n",
    "It initializes the environment in such a way that all the functions of PyCaret can work in harmony. This means the algorithms, transformations, and configurations you choose while setting up will be consistent throughout your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Informative Display: \n",
    "Once the setup function is run, it displays an informative grid that shows key details like the number of features, the number of samples, the transformation methods being used, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Flexibility: \n",
    "While setup does automate a lot of tasks, it doesn't take away your control. If you disagree with a preprocessing step it took, you can modify it using its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the setup function in PyCaret is your entry point into the library's streamlined workflow, taking care of a lot of the groundwork so you can focus on building and tuning your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we've employed feature selection. Using PyCaret has notably reduced our coding effort compared to scikit-learn.\n",
